# Compass app in Android

:watch: ​Mobile GIS & LBS asn1

## Description

A new start-up company asks you to develop a location-based fitness app based on Android.
The fitness app aims at encouraging the users to get out of their home and do a round trip
running or walking near their home.

:point_right: The app should read a list of possible checkpoints from the file system

:point_right: After starting the app, a user can select one checkpoint from a drop-down that they want to go to

:point_right: A basic compass screen shows the direction and distance to the checkpoint’s position
(like on a radar)

<p>Compass directs to the position of checkpoint</p>

:point_right: ​Show the current speed of the user and the temperature

:point_right: ​When the user reaches the checkpoint, the app should notify the user with either text or audio. 

:point_right: ​To make the trip a complete round trip, the compass should then point towards the starting location again.

:point_right: ​Once the user completed the round trip (i.e., arrive the starting location), the app should again notify the user, provide a reward, and save the data to a CSV file.
