# Compass app in Android
Mobile GIS & LBS asn1

## Description

A new start-up company asks you to develop a location-based fitness app based on Android.
The fitness app aims at encouraging the users to get out of their home and do a round trip
running or walking near their home.

- [x] The app should read a list of possible checkpoints from the file system
- [x] After starting the app, a user can select one checkpoint from a drop-down that they want to go to
- [ ] A basic compass screen shows the direction and distance to the checkpointâ€™s position
(like on a radar)
- [x] Show the current speed of the user and the temperature
- [ ] When the user reaches the checkpoint, the app should notify the user with either text or audio. 
- [x] To make the trip a complete round trip, the compass should then point towards the starting location again.
- [x] Once the user completed the round trip (i.e., arrive the starting location), the app should again notify the user, provide a reward, and save the data
(see below) to a CSV file.
